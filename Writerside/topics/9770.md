A US congressional committee is targeting Sequoia Capital after starting investigations into several other venture capital firms for their investment in Chinese technology companies. The House Select Committee on China is seeking information about Sequoia’s investments into artificial intelligence, semiconductor and quantum computing companies in the Asian country, as well as its recently announced split into three firms. In the split, Sequoia China was rebranded as HongShan.
