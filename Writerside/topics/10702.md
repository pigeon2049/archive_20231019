The Bank of Japan offered a more optimistic view of regional economies on Thursday, saying wage hikes were broadening, underscoring its growing conviction of progress towards achieving an inflation target of 2%. In a report, the bank's regional branch managers said many firms were undecided on the quantum of next year's pay hikes, however, highlighting uncertainty whether conditions would allow the central bank to phase out its massive stimulus.
