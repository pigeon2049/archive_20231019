Generative AI has led to a noticeable drop in creative quality standards, with AI-generated content often being of low quality. The problem lies in the fact that AI-generated content is statistically average, as models are trained to minimize a loss function and find an average that follows the 'average' input. The lack of guidance and alignment in generative AI has resulted in various issues, including offensive content and undisclosed AI-generated content. Legal threats, such as copyright infringement, are seen as a major threat to generative AI. The future of generative AI may be closed-source and centralized, leading to limited accessibility and openness in training datasets. While the negative sentiment around generative AI continues, other use cases of AI, such as retrieval-augmented generation and coding assistants, remain unaffected.
