Change Data Capture (CDC) is a design pattern used to monitor database changes and extend the reach beyond the database itself. It is important in software development as it simplifies the handling of distributed transactions and allows for more efficient and fault-tolerant systems. CDC changes the approach to building event-driven systems by offloading non-critical tasks to the background and optimizing performance.
